### How to run the project

To use this application, clone it from this repo.

In your terminal run:

```git clone https://github.com/umaryusuf/mws-part-3.git```  
or download the .zip file

then run:

```
cd mws-part-3
```

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software or use [chrome web server](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around to see what the current experience looks like.
